<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
	I am a computer engineer and like to work on low level softwares. I have
	experince in Linux driver development and bare metal applications to this
	extent. I also like to work on high level softwares if the project itself is
	interesting. My previous experiences are detailed in my
	<a href="/assets/pdf/ceyhun_sen_resume.pdf">resume</a>. I also occasionally
	write <a href="technical-writings/">technical articles</a> about my work.
</p>

<p>
	I like to driving and riding motorized vehicles, whether they are cars or
	motorcycles. I like to go fast and go far. To feed my inner speed
	demon, I play simulation games. On the other hand, I like to go slow in real
	life and enjoy the scenery. If I discover a cool spot or a route, I share it
	in my <a href="travel-logs/">travels logs</a>.
</p>

<p>
	I also share other miscellanous topics and thoughts on
	<a href="blog/">my blog</a>.

	I like to capture moments as photographs and videos. While I do it, I like

<p>
	I really like to listen to music. I mean, really. Even though I listen music
	nearly 24/7, don't know much about music or genres in general. Though this
	is extremely ironic, I create and share lot's of playlists on Spotify.

<p>
	I am a car racing fan whether it is F1, GT3 or rallying. Because I can't do
	these things in real life, I play simulation games. My favorite racing
	category is GT3. Even though I am a sim racer, I like to play casual racing
	games time to time.
