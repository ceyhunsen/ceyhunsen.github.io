	I am Ceyhun Şen, a computer engineer who likes low level programming and based in İstanbul/Türkiye.

<p>
	I specialize on embedded software, including driver development and real-time operating systems. I also like IOT stuff. Although I am a low level guy, I sometimes enjoy high level software too (back-end mostly).
