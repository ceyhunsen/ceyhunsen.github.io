	motorcyclist, a sim racer, a traveller and a videographer.
</p>

	this website.
</p>

<h2>Find Me On Other Platforms</h2>

<p>
	I am a supporter of open source softwares. I share my projects on my Github
	in that regard.

</ul>

<p>
	I like to capture moments as photographs and videos. While I do it, I like
	to portray them as cinematically as possible. I share them on various
	platforms.

	I really like to listen to music. I mean, really. Even though I listen music
	nearly 24/7, don't know much about music or genres in general. Though this
	is extremely ironic, I create and share lot's of playlists on Spotify.

<p>
	I am a car racing fan whether it is F1, GT3 or rallying. Because I can't do
	these things in real life, I play simulation games. My favorite racing
	category is GT3. Even though I am a sim racer, like to play casual racing
	games time to time.
