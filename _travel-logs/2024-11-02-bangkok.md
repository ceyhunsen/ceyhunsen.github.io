I went to Bangkok as a part of a work trip and stayed there for 2 weeks. As the
name suggests, it wasn't a holiday. Although I do think I couldn't experienced
the city as much as I could be, I have some things to tell about it.

While I was there, I decided to capture some footage with my phone, just to make
some edits after. I suggest you watching it before continuing.

## Streets

My first impression of the city was is how well organized it was. Even though
there are lots of cars and motorcycles on the streets, traffic jams were getting
untagled sooner or later. To a person who lives in Istanbul, this was definitely
a breeze.

Also another thing I noticed about traffic was that, most of the vehicles were
either taxis or food deliveries. Even the "normal looking" cars were doing taxi
work with mobile apps. Almost all of the 2 weeks I used taxis for transportation
and rarely been a passenger for a regular looking taxi. Most of them were normal
people with their own personal cars. This was kind of interesting.

Last thing about streets is there weren't much of pedastrians to be speak of. I
and my colleagues were the only pedastrians walking on sidewalks on those busy
streets, most of time. I don't know if we were almost always hung out on
turistic areas or people of Bangkok don't really walks. Still, it sometimes felt
like I was in a ghost town with so many cars.
