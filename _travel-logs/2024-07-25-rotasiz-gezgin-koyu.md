Rotasız Gezgin Koyu (English translation: Routeless Traveller Bay) is a remote
bay to chill out, located in Sarıyer/İstanbul. Which is at the very north-east
of the European Side. There are signs that says it's a private property but the
place says otherwise.

I sometimes go here to chill out, after work. You can bring your own camping
chair or sit on a rock to enjoy the view. There are also some small places to
camp. But beware that strong winds are coming from Black Sea.

Sunset is not as spectacular as it should be. There is a hill that blocks the
view. I got a feeling that sunrise should be better, though. Because east side
has a more clear view. But never been there early in the morning.

There are two possible entries to the bay and they are ending with two different
bays, which are not very connected. Each of the entry paths are narrow. Be
careful not to get yourself scratched by the bushes!

First entry hosts the smaller part of the bay. Once you pass the narrow path,
nice green view will welcome you. This part also has a small beach. Sand is
quite rough, though. I sometimes see people swimming in that beach and doing
high dives from rocks inside the sea.

Second part is much more bigger and higher than the sea level. It is not very
possible to swim here. But I like this part more because the view spots are
better. There are couple of cliffs. But please be careful when navigating around
because terrain is quite soft around one of the cliffs and it can cause
catastrophic results.

## Where It's Located Exactly

There are some public busses that goes to Rumelifeneri. There is a bus terminal that busses stop. After that, 10 minute walk is needed. So, it is possible to go there without having a vehicle. But I suggest going there with your own vehicle at your own pace, listening a relaxed music at the background. Because roads are twisted with good view. It is quite peaceful. But be cautious, if you ride a motorcycle: There are dogs. Dogs like to run towards you when you pass them. Even worse, they hide in blind spots and you can’t notice them once it’s too late and it is quite scary. Pass them slowly or hold your legs upwards and throttle pass them.
