          I am a computer engineer and like to work on low level softwares. I
          hav experince in Linux driver development and bare metal applications
          to this extent. I also like to work on high level softwares if the
          project itself is interesting. My previous experiences are detailed in
          my
          <a href="/ceyhun_sen_resume.pdf">resume</a>. I also occasionally write{" "}
          <a href="technical-writings/">technical articles</a> about my work.

          I like to driving and riding motorized vehicles, whether they are cars
          or motorcycles. I like to go fast and go far. To feed my inner speed
          demon, I play simulation games. On the other hand, I like to go slow
          in real life and enjoy the scenery. If I discover a cool spot or a
          route, I share it in my <a href="travel-logs/">travels logs</a>.

          I also share other miscellanous topics and thoughts on
