<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
	I am a computer engineer and like to work on low level softwares. I hav
	experince in Linux driver development and bare metal applications to this
	extent. I also like to work on high level softwares if the project itself is
	interesting. My previous experiences are detailed in my
	<a href="assets/pdf/ceyhun_sen_resume.pdf">resume</a>. I also occasionally
	write <a href="technical-writings/">technical articles</a> about my work.
</p>

<p>
	I like to driving and riding motorized vehicles, whether they are cars or
	motorcycles. I like to go fast and go far. To feed my inner speed
	demon, I play simulation games. On the other hand, I like to go slow in real
	life and enjoy the scenery. If I discover a cool spot or a route, I share it
	in my <a href="travel-logs/">travels logs</a>.
</p>

<p>
	I also share other miscellanous topics and thoughts on
	<a href="blog/">my blog</a>.
