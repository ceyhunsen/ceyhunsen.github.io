<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
	I am a computer engineer and like to work on low level softwares. I worked
	on Linux driver development and bare metal applications to this extent and I
	still do. I also like to work on high level softwares if the project is
	interesting. My previous experiences are detailed in my
	<a href="assets/pdf/ceyhun_sen_resume.pdf">resume</a>. I also occasionally
	write <a href="technical-writings/">technical articles</a> about my work.
</p>

<p>
	I like to drive/ride motorized vehicles whether they are cars or
	motorcycles. I like to both go fast and go far. To feed my inner speed
	demon, I play simulation games. On the other hand, I like to go slow in real
	life and enjoy the scenery to feed my inner wanderer. If I find a cool
	spot or a route, I share it on my <a href="travel-logs/">travels logs</a>.
</p>

<p>
	I also share other miscellanous things about me on
	<a href="blog/">my blog</a>.
