title: I Crashed My Motorcycle And Broke My Wrist
---

As I was closing my first anniversary on motorcycles, I crashed, on my own.
It was a sunny saturday which the dates were showing 18th of January, 2025 and
clocks were pointing 16:10, I couldn't slow down to a corner and went straight
outside the twisties, into the bushes. After I mowed the bushes, hit the little
trees and came to a stop. I was very fortunate to not hit anything during this
period until I came to a stop. At the very last moment, hit my left wrist to
a tree.

As a result, broke my left wrist. It didn't hurt after the crash and also not
too much afterwards. But the relocation operation which has done by a doctor, a
technician and my dad (yes they wanted help from him) hurt like hell. Glad it
only took 10-20 seconds. After this operation, doctors argued back and forth
that I should go into a surgery or not, thinking the operation was a failure.
But the final verdict was that the relocation was a success. Got discharged to
home afterwards.

It is needless to say that I am extremely lucky. If I was speeding, slid or
not holding my bike firmly with my legs, I would've hurt myself extremely bad. I
am also lucky because the narrow path that I snug in only had small trees and my
motorcycle hugged them to save me.

## Why and How Did I Crashed?

As I said, I wasn't speeding. Even though it was a cold day (10 C) road and tire
conditions were OK. But I wasn't paying attention to the road and this was the
main problem. I was very absent-minded about my personal matters couple of days
before the crash. I was riding it in auto-pilot mode. I learned that this is a
disastrous thing to do where one's reflexes are kind of down. Because it was
cold my hands got numb slowly. As a result, I couldn't pull the front brakes at
a level that I needed to (bad rear brakes my motorcycle has).

When I noticed I couldn't slowed down enough to the sharp and blind corner that
I was in, and got surprised. I thought to myself "What is going on at this very
moment?". It was incredibly fast. I couldn't do anything and just freezed. I
don't really remember the moment I hit the trees even though I was concious all
the time.

This whole crash sequence gave me the same vibes in the movies where a high
speed crash occurs: Time was slow before the crash. But when I saw the crash was
inevitable, it was an incredibly fast moment and background noise just wiped out
(I was listening music). I was really angry to myself about the crash afterwards
and yelled to myself. I was also very lucky that I didn't stuck under the bike
and quickly get myself out in that situation.

Luckily that road was very popular amongst the motorcyclist. People stopped and
helped me to get my motorcycle out of the bushes. They offered me help to move
my motorcycle in a safe place. Called myself an ambulance afterwards and my
parents.

I was wearing protective motorcycle equipment, from head to toe. But my gloves
(Held Madoc Max) didn't have wrist protection. I am not sure if it would've
protected me from this injury, if it has it though. I think I also hit my left
thigh because there is a bruise that I noticed afterwards. Other than these,
either I didn't hit anything or my protective equipments does their jobs
perfectly. Although I didn't find any deformations on my equipments.
