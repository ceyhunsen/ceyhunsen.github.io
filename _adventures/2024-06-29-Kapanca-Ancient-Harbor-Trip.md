title: A Trip To Kapanca Ancient Harbor
---

I went Mudanya/Bursa to see Kapanca Ancient Harbor from Istanbul, my home. Along
the way, I was astonished by the view of both old Yalova to Bursa and Mudanya's
road along the shoreline. Unfortunately, I couldn't take any photos while I was
riding (obviously).

I can't say the harbor is either big or small. Also there are hills near the
harbor, that people was also enjoying the view. So there were enough space
for all the people there.

## My Route

Bbecause I am living in Istanbul, I had to pass Yalova to arrive Bursa. I chose
to take the ferry, not the Osmangazi Bridge bacause of the prices. I am glad
that I took the ferry though. Old Yalova to Bursa road was awesome. Road's code
was D575.

After I arrived at Gemlik, I followed the coast (Gemlik-Mudanya road). Overall,
the view was great. There was a village that I liked: Altıntaş. Although I
didn't visit the village itself, it's location is great.

I had to take my motorcycle offroad, to get to the harbor. Road was a bit harsh
for my Pulsar, to be honest. Because of the soft terrain, it was also dangerous
too. I wasn't very cautious for that terrain but was very lucky to not drop my
bike.

That offroad near the harbor was weird. There was so many farm fields and the
altitude was a bit high for a place that is near the coast. It was breathtaking
nevertheless. I suggest anyone to take that path, even though it's a bit
dangerous. Just be careful and you will be fine.
