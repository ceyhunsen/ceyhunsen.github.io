I went Mudanya/Bursa to see Kapanca Ancient Harbor from Istanbul, my home. Along
the way, I was astonished by the view of both Yalova-Bursa road and Mudanya
shoreline. Unfortunately, I couldn't take any photos of the roads.

Harbor was neither big nor small. There were also hills near the harbor, which
supplied enough room for people to enjoy view. The natural shape of the harbor
is really interesting: Crescent. The rocks inside the sea are very small. They
probably won't hold any waves if there were to be. But they look nice in summer,
or any day without waves.

There were some small boats at the beach. I sat one of them to rest, which was
turned upside down. Then wrote some thoughts to my notebook. I don't know if big
ships ever ported here in the history, but it seemed that boat was the biggest
that place can host.

I had to pass Yalova to arrive Bursa. I chose to take the ferry and not the
Osmangazi Bridge bacause of the high toll prices. And I am glad that I took the
ferry. The D575, a.k.a Yalova-Bursa road was awesome.

After I arrived to Gemlik, I followed the shoreline (Gemlik-Mudanya road).
Overall, the view was great. There was a village that I really liked because of
where it is placed: Altıntaş. If I were to pass that road again and have spare
time, I will probably visit that village.

Finally, I had to take my motorcycle offroad. To be honest, road was a bit harsh
for my Pulsar. But the view was great. There were so many farm fields and the
altitude was a quite high for a place that is near the coast. Nevertheless, it
was breathtaking.

Google Maps suggested me to go to the top of the hill near that harbor. Which is
most of the photos you see online. Because I don't have a phone holder and just
listen the sound guidance, I followed it without knowing. But the road was
blocked by so many ways. I am not sure if it is dangerous for vehicles to pass
that road or some other thing that people shouldn't go is at the top. So I went
back, being disappointed. Saw another way that goes that direction and took it.
Glad I did because that was the actual route. Harbor was on my right after the
signs.

High altitude near the coast means a steep descend. Cherry on top: Soft terrain.
I didn't realize terrain was soft and lost control at a speed of ~15 kph, which
is a lot considering steepness. Fortunately I was very lucky and didn't fall.
Please be more careful than me if you were to go there.
