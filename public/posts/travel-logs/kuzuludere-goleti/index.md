Kuzuludere Göleti (pond) was quite the stunner for me. It is located at Yalıköy
district, which is in Çatalca/İstanbul. This pond is great for spending some
alone time (reading books, enjoying the view...) and picnicing.

I went to Yalıköy multiple times to visit it's beach. But I am grateful, that
one day, I decided to explore the district and not just sit next to the beach.

I suggest listening Blood Like Lemonade from Morcheeba, while reading this. This
is the song that describes my vibe on this place.

There is a small dam nearby the pond. When I visited here in september, there
was no running water through, though. So I took a quick walk on top of the dam.
It wasn't crazy high but still was a bit scary to walk on top of it. You could
see the whole lake but not the whole place from there.

There were some people picnicing near the entrance. Because the place is quite
far away from anything, the amount of people were very low for a place this.
Also most of them were at the entrance, near the dam. But the road was looking quite
long so I decided to ride more and rest on a place that is more seperated from
people. On my way, I saw a cool tent. It looked like a futuristic base on an
icelandic themed film/video game (First thought was Death Stranding). The moment
I saw that tent defined this place for me honestly.

Road took me to the biggest plain part of this pond area. This plains felt like
this place gets filled with more water on rainy seasons. Because there were a
huge plain area and the borders were ~1 meter taller then the plain area,
surrounded with trees. But when I got there, it wasn't. So, I enjoyed this too
big of an area to sit on my camp chair, drink my tea and read my book.

Terrain was not soft, nor muddy. Even though I have a street oriented
motorcycle, I didn't struggled to move around. Because this is a pond, there
were quite amount of flies. But it was bearable for me to enjoy this beautiful
place. Also more I spent my time here, more the flies lost interest in me. This
was also nice.

By the time I decided to leave the place, I had visitors: Cows. Sheperds were
using this place to graze them. Some of them got scared by me, most of them
didn't.

## Where Is It

As I said before, it is in Yalıköy district, which is in Çatalca/İstanbul. You
need to go, maybe 50 to 100 meters of offroad. Beware that terrain is bumpy
for a standard car; Careful with the bottom of your car.
